#### 1Ô∏è‚É£LandDAO 1.0 <a href="#id-1-landdao-1.0" id="id-1-landdao-1.0"></a>

After fundraising, LandDAO's initial focus will be on three key areas:

* Acquisition of initial land portfolios
* Improvement of lands
* DAO and governance setup

For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch, LandDAO plans to acquire its first land portfolios in the following countries:

* **Africa:** Ghana, Kenya, Namibia
* **Europe:** Portugal, Spain, Scotland

Over the last 15 months, the LandDAO team has extensively visited these countries to view potential lands and build relationships with landowners, key stakeholders, traditional rulers, land surveyors, and lawyers.

While lands may not be purchased in all of these countries, they represent the most likely locations for the initial land acquisitions due to the unique opportunities they currently offer. Both residential and agricultural lands will be acquired for LandDAO 1.0.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£LandDAO 2.0 <a href="#id-2-landdao-2.0" id="id-2-landdao-2.0"></a>

The core modules of the product will be released with LandDAO 2.0

* Land Tokenization Protocol
* RWA Land Trading Marketplace
* Full DAO and Governance Execution
* RWA Smart Contracts

The specific details for each of these modules will be announced in future White Paper updates. The full product, including the ability for traders to buy and sell land on the LandDAO RWA marketplace, will be launched with the release of LandDAO 2.0. At this stage, the full DAO organization will also be formally launched.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£LandDAO 3.0 <a href="#id-3-landdao-3.0" id="id-3-landdao-3.0"></a>

The roadmap for LandDAO 3.0 will focus on:

* Physical possession of land
* Scaling

With the introduction of the "physical possession module," LRWA owners can take physical possession of land if they meet certain conditions.

After the LandDAO 2.0 MVP product-market fit is fully validated, the scaling phase will focus on acquiring more land in different countries to expand the total lands under the DAO's management. To finance the acquisition of larger land parcels, LandDAO plans to launch a series of dedicated land acquisition funds.

For scaling, the DAO plans to use a mix of equity (funds raised by the DAO) and crypto mortgage loans to leverage land purchases. Each purchase will be financed with at least **50% equity** to mitigate risks.
