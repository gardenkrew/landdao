#### üìúSmart Contracts <a href="#smart-contracts" id="smart-contracts"></a>

LandDAO plans to build its RWA blockchain solution using an existing Layer 1 (L1) blockchain suitable for real-world asset tokenization. Our blockchain technical development team is currently reviewing the following L1 blockchains to select the most suitable solution: **Solana, Sui, Mantra, Near, Hedera, Avalanche and Injective.**

#### üìàTokenomics <a href="#tokenomics" id="tokenomics"></a>

* The total LandDAO token supply is **1 billion (1.000.000.000)**. This represents a fixed maximum supply, with no further tokens to be minted after the Token Generation Event (TGE).
* The largest allocation of LandDAO tokens is for **land acquisitions**, with **45%** of the total supply. This allocation ensures the DAO has sufficient financial resources to acquire land in all target regions.
* **14%** of the tokens are reserved for the IDO: **5%** for private sales and **9%** for public sales.
* **14%** is reserved for the **DAO Foundation/Treasury** for marketing and operational expenses. Of this, 1% is for community support incentives, 1% for partnerships, 2% for the go-to-market airdrop, and 10% serves as a long-term reserve.
* **25%** of the token supply is reserved for team members, and **2%** for advisors.

#### ‚è≥Token Vesting Schedule <a href="#token-vesting-schedule" id="token-vesting-schedule"></a>

* More than **70% of the total tokens are initially locked**, with a gradual unlock over the next 5 years to ensure sustainability and long-term alignment of stakeholder interests.
* The sale of any tokens from the **Land Acquisition pool (45%)** to institutional buyers is subject to a **3-year vesting period**.
* Tokens sold in the **private IDO** are subject to a **12-month lock-up period** and subsequent distribution over 6 months.
* Tokens sold in the public **IDO** are subject to a **3-month lock-up period** and subsequent distribution over 3 months.
* Tokens assigned to **Early Advisors** have a **1-year cliff period** and subsequent distribution over 3 months.
* Tokens assigned to **Team Members** have a **4-year vesting period** and a **2-year cliff**, with distribution starting from the 25th month.

#### üî•Token BuyBack and Burning <a href="#token-buyback-and-burning" id="token-buyback-and-burning"></a>

DAO profits are distributed to token holders through a buyback and burn mechanism. **Eighty percent (80%) of quarterly DAO profits** are used to buy LandDAO tokens back from the market and burn them, similar to the model used by Binance for BNB tokens. This deflationary burning event will lead to a continuous reduction in token supply, increasing scarcity.
