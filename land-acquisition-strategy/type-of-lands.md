# üó∫Ô∏è Type of lands

LandDAO's definition of "land ownership" is **leasehold ownership** for a defined number of years, and not freehold ownership. Residential lands traded on LandDAO are assigned a **30 to 50-year leasehold**, depending on the specific country, with a legal optional clause to renew for additional years.

Most countries do not allow foreigners to hold **freehold land ownership**. It is also not common for citizens to have freehold ownership in their country. While citizens may have a 10-20 year longer leasehold than foreigners, in most countries both citizens and foreigners are subject to approximately **50-year leasehold ownership** with a renewal option.

Consequently, freehold ownership of land is not a relevant option to consider when evaluating lands in general. Therefore, if a country's land laws allow foreigners to hold leasehold ownership, LandDAO defines it as a country that allows foreigners to own land (which is **LandDAO's definition of land ownership**).

**LandDAO is focused on two main types of land:**

* **Residential Lands**: Parcels that can be developed into homes for people to live in. These lands are targeted toward private land buyers, real estate developers, and land price speculators.
* **Agricultural Farm Lands**: Lands suitable for farming and agribusiness. These lands are targeted toward private and commercial farming companies, as well as land price speculators.

A farm lease contract can be for a minimum duration of 5 years with an option to renew at the end of each lease period. LandDAO operates agricultural farmlands only in certain countries.
