# üåç Land Acquisition

While developed countries have **fully functional and reliable land registration systems** at a national or state level, many emerging and developing countries lack such robust systems. However, it is important to note that not all emerging countries face these issues to the same extent.

For instance, countries like South Africa, Argentina, and Brazil have had **reliable land management systems in place for over a decade**. Kenya, on the other hand, has made **significant nationwide improvements in its land registration management systems** over the last five years.

The process of land acquisition is generally **very time-consuming** and can take between **6 to 12 months** to complete. For each country where LandDAO decides to operate, a **dedicated land acquisition team** will be formed, consisting of local land experts and core LandDAO team members.

To **mitigate transaction risks**, experienced **land surveyors and lawyers** are assigned to execute all relevant work, including land search, vacancy checks, historical review, resolution of land ownership disputes, active litigation management, legal contract execution, and official land registration. L**andDAO will only acquire land that can be officially registered** with the national government of each country in which it operates.
