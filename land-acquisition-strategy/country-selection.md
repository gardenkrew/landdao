# ðŸ§­ Country Selection

Ceteris paribus, LandDAO uses the following criteria to evaluate countries for investment:

| Selection Criteria              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ease of Land Acquisition**    | <p>Minimal restrictions for non-citizens to acquire land. Some<br>countries have very easy and clearly defined process for<br>foreigners to acquire lands, while others are too<br>complicated or bar foreigners.</p> |
| **Openness of Country**         | <p>Popularity with tourists and digital nomads. Countries that<br>are popular with tourists and digital nomads are the<br>countries that land buyers will likely be interested in</p>                                  |
| **Market Potential**            | High potential for market value appreciation of lands                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **General Safety**              | Countries with high levels of crime are to be avoided                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Cost of Lands**               | Affordability and value proposition of land acquisition                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **English Language Propensity** | Ease of communication in business transactions                                                                                                                                                                           |

LandDAO only operates in countries where non-citizens are permitted to own land. Some countries have specific restrictions on the type of land non-citizens can own. The number in brackets represents the number of years for which land can be leased to foreigners.

These country selections are preliminary, and the DAO will vote and make final decisions on which countries to invest in. Lands on LandDAO are also classified by country, e.g., "**Portfolio Portugal**", "**Portfolio Ghana**", and "**Portfolio Kenya**". Each land portfolio has specific legal restrictions regarding the types of investors who can own land in that country.

#### Cluster Concentration Model <a href="#cluster-concentration-model" id="cluster-concentration-model"></a>

LandDAO plans to use a concentrated cluster approach for land acquisition. The goal is to acquire a large cluster of lands within each immediate operational area, rather than buying small acreages of land in different locations that are far from each other (geographical proximity).
