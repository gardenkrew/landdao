# üìÉ LandDAO Executive Summary

#### üìñReal-World Assets: From Projection to Exponential Reality <a href="#real-world-assets-from-projection-to-exponential-reality" id="real-world-assets-from-projection-to-exponential-reality"></a>

According to a July 2023 report by Binance titled _‚ÄúReal-World Assets ‚Äì State of the Market‚Äù_, the tokenized asset market was projected to grow from **$310 billion in 2022** to **$16 trillion by 2030**. Tokenized real estate, bonds, gold, equities, and ETFs are expected to drive the bulk of this growth. However, more recent data from RedStone Research shows that **the value of tokenized real-world assets (excluding stablecoins) reached $15.2 billion by December 2024**, and **surpassed $24 billion by June 2025**, marking an **annual growth rate of 85%** ‚Äî far exceeding earlier projections and confirming RWA as one of the fastest-growing categories in blockchain.

Leading this trend is **Ondo Finance**, which as of April 2024 had a market cap between **$1.3‚Äì1.6 billion**. Ondo provides on-chain access to traditional financial products (TradFi) like ETFs from BlackRock and Vanguard that invest in high-grade U.S. Treasuries. These assets become accessible 24/7 and tradable for a global audience ‚Äî including users previously restricted from traditional finance platforms.

Another major entrant is **BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund**, launched in March 2024, which attracted **$245 million** in its first week and grew to over **$1.4 billion AUM by mid-2025**. The fund tokenizes short-term U.S. Treasury bills and distributes yield to token holders via smart contracts.

In parallel, **institutional players such as Fidelity, JPMorgan, and Apollo** have begun launching or backing tokenized funds, further validating the RWA category as a credible financial infrastructure layer for traditional finance.

#### üèòÔ∏èReal Estate RWA <a href="#real-estate-rwa" id="real-estate-rwa"></a>

The global real estate market is estimated to reach **$637.8 trillion by the end of 2024**, yet it remains largely untouched by digital innovation. Legal friction, illiquidity, and high transaction costs have long hindered modernization. Now, with the rise of **Real Estate RWA**, real-world properties are being fractionalized and made accessible via blockchain.

Several notable projects have emerged:

* **Propy**: enables blockchain-based real estate sales using smart contracts;
* **Blocksquare** and **Rex Protocol**: offer infrastructure for turning properties into fungible tokens;
* **RealT**, **CitaDAO**: focus on fractional ownership of residential and commercial assets;
* **CityDAO**: uniquely dedicated to tokenizing land.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏èLandDAO's Position in the Ecosystem <a href="#landdaos-position-in-the-ecosystem" id="landdaos-position-in-the-ecosystem"></a>

**LandDAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization focused exclusively on **land** as an RWA category. Unlike most Real Estate RWA projects that tokenize residential or commercial properties, LandDAO acquires large plots of land, improves them, and tokenizes them into fractional shares via blockchain. These land parcels are not virtual but **real, verified plots**.

DAO participants pool funds to purchase land in jurisdictions where foreign ownership is legally accessible ‚Äî starting with regions in **Europe and Africa**. The ownership of land is represented via on-chain tokens and backed by legal documentation. Participants **own pari passu shares** of all land acquired and improved by the DAO.

Core features include:

* **Tokenization of physical land** into tradeable on-chain assets;
* **Smart contract-based certification** of land ownership;
* **Positive social impact** through economic investment into underdeveloped areas;
* **Quarterly DAO profit-sharing** through token buybacks and burns.

All users must pass KYC checks to ensure compliance with international regulations. Citizens of the **United States, Iran, Somalia, and North Korea** are restricted from participating.

LandDAO‚Äôs long-term vision is to build an **on-chain equivalent of Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL)** ‚Äî a $30 billion NYSE-listed land company owning over 2 million acres. Should LandDAO scale successfully, it could become a dominant player in the traditional land investment market and foster a new global community of investors driving real-world economic development via tokenized land ownership.
